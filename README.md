# Networking

## Network types and Standards

### Peer-based
#### Peer-based is a network that connects to each other locally without a centralized administrating system. 
#### The main benefit of Peer-based networks is their simplicity. They don't require much hardware or any at all as they don’t need a mediator of control or authority, they just connect to each other. Because of this the resource implications are very low. They don’t require much setup compared to other networks such as servers. A constraint of Peer-based would be their scalability. They are generally not very applicable for large networks. Additionally, they have a lack of security as there is no controlling factor.

### Client-Server
#### Client-Server networks all connect to one point in LAN. They are centralized. There will be a centralized administrating system that controls all of the users in the networks and things like authentication and group policies.
#### The main benefit of Client-Server networks is their management. The administrating system has control over all systems in the network. Allowing for easy changes to things like passwords and access to files and data. Furthermore, it has good scalability as if the server has increased use and is being overloaded another server can be spun-up or setup to handle the increase in users. A constraint would be the costs included with Client-Server networks. The hardware has to be bought to manage the network and specific specialists are required to setup and maintain the network. Furthermore, it is not as robust. If the server goes down the whole network goes down. 

### Cloud
#### Cloud based networks are services clients will hire. They will be managed and setup by the provider but the client just pays for the server space they use and the access to it. The network is essentially Client-Server but the server aspect is run and managed by an outside party thus making it decentralized. Additionally, the majority of cloud based services will be virtualized. This is because virtualizing their servers allows them to use all of the server and not waste any unused hardware allowing them to provide the service at cheaper rates.
#### The benefits are that the cost is greatly reduced as you don’t need the hardware for a server or the staff to manage it. You can access the network practically anywhere and from any device. All of the security aspects are managed by the provider as well. The scalability is innovating. If a client needs more capacity or resource they can click a button and a new server space is Spun-up and available to access. Cloud networks also allow for collaboration as they provide services for clients to access and edit work at the same time in real-time. A constraint would be the lack of control of data. If a payment is missed for the services, the provider can stop access to all of the client’s data until payment is made or even remove all of their data if they miss a deadline. Furthermore, if the provider’s services fail or the internet connect required to access it fails there is no local collection of the data so it become inaccessible.
