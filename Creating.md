## Network Requirements 
---
### Local Network 1
---
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router.

The PCs should use IPs:
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102

The Server should use the IP:
192.168.1.10

The Router (aka Gateway) should use the IP:
192.168.1.1

### Local Network 2
---
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router.

The PCs should use IPs:
192.168.10.100
192.168.10.101
192.168.10.102

The Server should use the IP:
192.168.10.10

The Router (or Gateway) should use the IP:
192.168.10.1

### Wide Area Network
---
Both the should be connected and be able to communicate with each other and allow any PC on either network to PING and other PC and any network.


### Expanding The Local Area Networks
---
Setup DHCP on either (or both) servers so that the correct IP addresses are given to the appropriate PCs
Setup DNS on either (or both) servers so that Network 1 uses character names from the Simpsons (e.g. Homer, Marge, Bart, etc for devices) and Network 2 uses character names from Family Guy (e.g. Peter, Lois, Stewie, Brian, etc for devices)

### Testing
---
Test DHCP allocations are correct
Test local connectivity using IP based PINGs between PCs, Printers and the Server on both networks
Test local connectivity using DNS based PINGs on all the devices
Test connectivity across both networks (PCs, Servers, etc.)
Use the simulation mode in Packet Tracer to help illustrate successful testing
